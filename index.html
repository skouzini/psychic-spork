      <h2>Haven't you heard about CLUB NIGHT??</h2>
      <p>Club night is the coolest thing to happen since Cosmo the Cougar (no offense). Have you been eyeing a cute girl and wondering how to break the ice? The Salsa Club would be perfect for you (both)! Did your dungeon master recently leave on a mission? Have no fear! The D&D Club is here!</p>
      <p>Just paruse through our website and get familiar with our clubs, or see 'em in action every tuesday night at 5pm!</p>
