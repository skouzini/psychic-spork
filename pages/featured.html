            <p class="featuredClubDescription">Quark is BYU's official Science-Fiction and Fantasy Club; although
                honestly, we're just into all things geek. Aside from occasional socials, we don't hold meetings like
                other clubs; rather, because our members are interested in so many areas of geekdom, we offer a variety
                of regular or semi-regular activities catering to these differing interests. Attend one or ATTEND THEM
                ALL!</p>
